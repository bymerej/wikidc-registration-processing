This is a collection of scripts that enable
the reasonable (?) processing of exports from Drupal
for Wikimania 2012 registrations.

First, get 'export.csv' by loading this URL:
https://secure.wikidc.org/wm/reg/badges/export

Then, create a admin.cfg file (start by copying
admin.cfg.EXAMPLE onto admin.cfg).

Then, run 'make'.

NOTE: You need python3 installed.

-- Asheesh.
